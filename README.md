Project IOT

This project presents a **Smart Plant Watering System** using **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology to automate irrigation. It monitors soil moisture levels in real-time and activates a water pump when the soil is dry—helping conserve water, reduce manual labor, and ensure optimal plant care.

> 🎯 Built as part of an academic project by Computer Science students at R.N.G. Patel Institute of Technology.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to automate plant watering based on soil moisture data using low-cost components and open-source technologies. The system is scalable, energy-efficient, and ideal for both home gardening and large-scale agriculture.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🌱 Real-time **Soil Moisture Monitoring**
* 🚰 **Automatic Water Pump Control** via Relay Module
* 📲 Optional **Remote Monitoring** using Wi-Fi (ESP32)
* 🔋 Supports **Battery/Solar Power**
* 💡 Built on Arduino or ESP32
* 🧠 Future-ready for cloud integration (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak)

## 🧠 Tech Stack
